# Emergency Management Loose Coupler

## Purpose
The purpose of the emergency management loose coupler (EMLC) is to provide an information sharing mechanism where the most critical pieces of information about an emergency management event can be exchanged.  This information describes at a high level the who, what, when, and where of something of interest to emergency management personnel, which includes first responders.  That something of interest (event) can be an incident, a resource (personnel, equipment), a sensor, infrastructure, or mutual aid requests.  The EMLC also provides a flexible mechanism to describe the event in more detail.

## Scope
The scope of the this IEPD ranges from local to federal.  The intent is any agency/group within emergency management and response can use this exchange to share high level information.

## Rationale
There currently aren’t any data standards that support the wide array of information that the EMLC supports.  The current data standards often go into great detail about a specific topic or domain.  The EMLC is designed to be lightweight and share only the most critical pieces of information about a wide range of things that are important to emergency management.  This provides a breadth of information to a given emergency manager during an emergency incident.  It also allows this information to be more easily shared with other agencies up and down the jurisdiction stack.    

## Information
The basis of the EMLC is sharing the who, what, when, and where of something of interest to emergency management and response.  The required information is kept to a minimum for efficiency sake, while optional elements are available to provide more detail and supplemental information to the who, what, when, and where of an event.  Examples of what might be shared are: first responder location, first responder sensor readings, infrastructure status, emergency incident status, mutual aid requests, mutual aid responses, and standalone sensors.  The flexible structure of the EMLC allows future needs to be easily incorporated.

## Interactions
Typical interactions for the EMLC include mobile devices sending responder location and/or sensor information from the field to an agency’s servers, different enterprise level servers sharing information between agencies, and standalone sensors sending sensor readings to an enterprise level server for distribution.
