Details:
# This IEPD has been evaluated using the NIEM ConTesA business rule engine that utilizes schematron.

1. How NIEM conformance was verified:
    a. Automatic (tool) checks were performed with NIEM-aware and XML Schema tools identified below.
    b. Manual (subjective) checks on conformance rules were performed by the author/certifier.
    c. A general manual (subjective) cross-check for adherence to conformance rules and quality
    assurance was performed by several of the authorâ€™s colleagues who understand NIEM and
    XML Schema.

2. Tools employed:
    a. NIEM Schema Subset Generator (SSGT) (for NIEM 4.0) generated all subset schema documents.
    b. Intellij 2019.1.3 Ultimate was used for cross-validation of XML schemas and XML instances.
    c. XMLSpy Professional v2019 rel. 3 was used for validation of extension schema documents,
        constraint schema documents, and all other XML artifacts. This tool also validated a number of NIEM NDR rules.
    d. oXygen XML Editor v21.1 was used to cross-validate XML schemas and XML instances.
    e. NIEM ConTesA (Conformance Testing Assistant) was used for NIEM NDR and MPD validation.

3. Results:
    a. No known major issues remain.
    b. All XML artifacts are well-formed and valid.
    c. Attached conformance report from NIEM ConTesA indicates 100% pass for all automatically
    checked NIEM rules.
    d. Author and SMEs verified that several warnings by tools are not relevant to this IEPD.
