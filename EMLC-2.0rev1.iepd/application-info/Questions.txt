Questions for Kamran
====================

Critical Questions:

1) How to implement augmentation point for restriction?
    See em_base.xsd EventIdentificationType
    Workaround: implemented as extension

2) Where is the definition for http://reference.niem.gov/niem/resource/mpd/catalog/3.0/ ?
    Workaround: ignored validation for emlc_catalog file
    NOT AN XSD FILE, no validation

3) What is the conformance target for catalog files?
    Workaround: set to ExtensionSchemaDocument

Problem with XJC
==================

[ERROR] Property "Rows" is already defined. Use &lt;jaxb:property> to resolve this conflict.

[ERROR] The following location is relevant to the above error
  line 680 of file:/Users/charles.letcher/Documents/GitHub/_NIEM/EMLC_NIEM/schemas/subset/niem-4.0/niem/external/ogc/gml/3.2.1/geometryPrimitives.xsd
Work around: changed line 680 to rows2


Nice to know questions:

1) Does each xsl file need an appinfo section?
